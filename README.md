# Word Of Wisdom: TCP Server with PoW

## Design
I used HashCash to develop PoW. This algorithm was specially created for tasks to combat DDOS and spam. It is also used in Bitcoin. It provides an efficient verification process and is CPU-bound.

## Run in docker
```bash
make up
```

## Open logs
```bash
make logs
```

## Other commands
```bash
make down
make restart
```
